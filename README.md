# Welcome to my Testing Ruby with RSpec Learning Repository

This repository was created as part of my journey to learn and master RSpec, the most popular testing library for the Ruby programming language, through the course "Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide" offered on Udemy. It contains code samples, exercises, and practice projects that I will be working on as I progress through the lessons. 

## About the Course
The course provides a comprehensive overview of RSpec, starting from the basics and gradually moving into more advanced topics. 

One of the key methodologies covered in this course is Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the actual implementation. This approach encourages simpler, more decoupled code, ultimately making you a better developer. Testing requires careful thought about the design and structure of your program, including its classes, methods, and objects.

## Course Topics
In this course, we will explore a wide range of RSpec topics, including but not limited to:

- Installation and Setup
- Project Initialization
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- let Variables
- before and after Hooks
- Subjects
- Shared Examples and Contexts
- Built-in Matchers
- Mocks and Doubles
- Instance Doubles and Class Doubles

 ## About Me

I'm a self-taught programmer with a strong interest in improving code quality through testing. Currently, I'm focused on mastering RSpec, the go-to testing framework for Ruby. Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into Test-Driven Development (TDD) and write more reliable and maintainable code.

Happy testing!
